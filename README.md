# Lecture Summarizer

this small hobby side prjoect aims to save me from watching video lectures 

## Goal of current version:
- transcribe, translate and summarize video lectures in a `notepad` file in an acceptable runtime

## Current Techstack(libraries):
- `openai-whisper` to transcribe audio
- `transformers` models to translate and summarize
- `moviepy` to convert video to audio
- `pydub` to cut large audios to smaller chunks

# Will do in coming days to ease collaberation:
- add comments 
- make a proper README
